The project was part of the Data Analytics program I attended at Career Foundry.

In the project, I covered the role of a data analyst working for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app.

The goal was to uncover more informations about _sales patterns_ (such as, busiest day and busiest hours from an order number perspective) and _customers purchasing behaviour_ (segmentation according to age, income,  regions, and so on).

Short description of the project (Project Brief 3 and 4).

**Note:** Instacart is a real company thatâ€™s made their data available online. However, sensitive contents (such as prices and customers information) have been fabricated for the purpose of this project.
