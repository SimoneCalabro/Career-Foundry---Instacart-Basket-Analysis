# Career Foundry - Instacart Basket Analysis
This repository contains all data (including my Jupyter notebooks and scripts) related to the project "Instacart Basket Analysis".

The project was part of the Data Analytics program I attended at Career Foundry.

All analysis have been performed using **Python** (Anaconda navigator plus Jupyter).

## Project overview:

I covered the role of a data analyst working for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app.

The goal was to uncover more informations about _sales patterns_ (such as, busiest day and busiest hours from an order number perspective) and _customers purchasing behaviour_ (segmentation according to age, income,  regions, and so on).

**Note:** Instacart is a real company thatâ€™s made their data available online. However, sensitive contents (such as prices and customers information) have been fabricated for the purpose of this project.

## Folders:
Here you will find a list of folders contained in the repository, along with a short description.

- **Instacart basket analysis:** the main folder. It contains 4 sub folders:
  - **01. Project management:** Contains the Project brief (additional information on project's overview, context and goal).
  - **03. Scripts** Contains all Python scripts (Jupyter noteebook). Inside scripts you can find all data manipulations described in the _"Skills"_ section below.

## Skills:
A summary of what I applied:

WIP - to be adjusted
- Cleaning data
  - Data wrangling (renaming columns, dropping columns, transposing, changing columns datatype)
  - Consistency checks (handling missing values, duplicates and mixed-type data)
- Data dictionary
- Subset
- Descriptive statistics
- Grouping and aggregating
- Creating crosstabs
- Deriving new variables (if-statements, loc function and for-loops)
- Create visualizations (histograms, bar charts, stacked bar charts, line charts, pie charts, scatterplots)
- Merging two dataframes (concatenating, append, join)
- Exporting dataframes (both in CSV and PKL format)
