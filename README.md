# Career Foundry - Instacart Basket Analysis
This repository contains all data (including my Jupyter notebooks and scripts) related to the project "Instacart Basket Analysis".

The project was part of the Data Analytics program I attended at Career Foundry.

All analysis have been performed using **Python** (Anaconda navigator plus Jupyter).

## Project overview:

I covered the role of a data analyst working for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app.

The goal was to uncover more informations about _sales patterns_ (such as, busiest day and busiest hours from an order number perspective) and _customers purchasing behaviour_ (segmentation according to age, income,  regions, and so on).

**Note:** Instacart is a real company that’s made their data available online. However, sensitive contents (such as prices and customers information) have been fabricated for the purpose of this project.

## Folders:
Here you will find a list of folders contained in the repository, along with a short description.

- **Instacart basket analysis:** the main folder. It contains 4 sub folders:
  - **01. Project management:** Contains the Project brief (additional information on project's overview, context and goal).
  - **03. Scripts:** Contains all Python scripts (Jupyter noteebook). Inside scripts you can find all data manipulations described in the _"Skills"_ section below.
  - **04. Analisys/Visualizations:** Contains all the charts and visualizations created while carrying out the project.
  - **05. Sent to client:** Contains an excel report that summarize the population flow, all the wrangling steps, the consistency checks, the columns derived and the answers to the key questions (the analysis' main goal).

**Note:** Section _02._ is missing because it contained the datasets used, both _Original data_ (raw) and _Prepared Data_ (manipulated).
Since files size was higher than 25 MB, it was impossible to upload them.

## Dataset:
As explained above, Instacart made their data open source.

Keep in mind that sensitive contents (such as prices and customers information) have been fabricated for the purpose of this project.

Below you can find a link to download the orders dataset, the customers dataset and a Github data dictionary containing a brief description of the variables.

## Tools:
- Anaconda
  - Jupyter

## Libraries:
Here you can find a list of all libraries installed and imported into my scripts:

- pandas
- numpy
- os
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy

## Skills:
A summary of what I applied:

- Cleaning data
  - Data wrangling (renaming columns, dropping columns, transposing, changing columns datatype)
  - Consistency checks (handling missing values, duplicates and mixed-type data)
- Creating a data dictionary
- Creating a Subset
- Calculate descriptive statistics
- Grouping and aggregating data
- Creating crosstabs
- Deriving new variables (if-statements, loc function and for-loops)
- Create visualizations (histograms, bar charts, stacked bar charts, line charts, pie charts, scatterplots)
- Merging two dataframes (concatenating, append, join merge)
- Exporting dataframes (both in CSV and PKL format)
